## Project description

[Rae Riding Lessons](http://raeridinglessons.infinityfreeapp.com/) is website designed so that users can signup for horse riding lessons. 

Once a user registersfor an account, they can veiw a calendar of lessons that are available to them based on the their skill level. The user can then sign up for the lesson which will be added to another calendar on the user's profile page. Additionally, an admin can make changes to the user's skill level, make a user an admin, make notes about users, add news to the home page, and add new lessons for users.

## How to use the website

Users can visit the website and veiw the home page (Fig. 1) and the about page (Fig. 2). However users will need an accout to access the lesson page and a profile page.

Also, the admin can create new lessons by adding a title, a description, date, and a start and end time. The admin will also need to specify if the lesson is private (one user) or for a group (two users) and set a skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced). (Fig. 9)

Further, admins can add news that will display on the home page and can view a list of all the users that have an account (Fig. 10). From this list the admin can change the user's skill level and can promote other users to admin status. Additionally, the admin can leave notes about each user. Finally, admins can update their information such at name, address, and contact information (Fig. 7).
