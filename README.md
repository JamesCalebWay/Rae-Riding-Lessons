## Project description

[Rae Riding Lessons](http://raeridinglessons.infinityfreeapp.com/) is website designed so that users can signup for horse riding lessons. 

Once a user registersfor an account, they can veiw a calendar of lessons that are available to them based on the their skill level. The user can then sign up for the lesson which will be added to another calendar on the user's profile page. Additionally, an admin can make changes to the user's skill level, make a user an admin, make notes about users, add news to the home page, and add new lessons for users.

## How to use the website

To use the website a user will need to create an account and sign in.

To create an account the user will need their name, email, phone number, an address, and will need to create a password.

To sign in, the user will need to enter the email and password that they used to sign up.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
